# Sample use

This directory contains PDF files and sample scripts to run the scripts on them.

You can just have a look to the `go.run-me.sh`. We also provide the bash file and ini file for the `pdf-form-fill.py` script, that are generated by the `pdf-form-identify-fields.py` script.

If you want to try the scripts on your own PDF files, copy the scripts to the directory with your PDF files, and run them from there.
